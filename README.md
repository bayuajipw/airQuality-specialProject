This repository is for KP purposes, made by Bayu, Izatul, Ruth, and the idea is from MrHalim.
In realizing occupational safety and health, especially in laboratory workshops, the design and development of a prototype gas detection device for CO, smoke, fire, dust, temperature, and humidity are carried out, integrated into the Raspberry Pi 4 microcontroller. To determine these parameters, MQ-2 sensor, KY-026 sensor, GP2Y1014AU0F sensor, DHT22 sensor, LCD, water pump, exhaust fan, and buzzer are utilized. In addition to parameter monitoring, exhaust fan control is implemented to condition dust and smoke, while water pump control is employed to extinguish fire by activating the exhaust fan and water pump automatically. Measurement data will be displayed on the Node-RED user interface. The resulting device can detect CO gas levels, smoke, fire, dust, measure room temperature and humidity, provide danger alerts, and control the exhaust fan and water pump.
